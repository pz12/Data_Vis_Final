# Opoiod Epidemic: Drug Overdoses in the USA from 1999-2015
### Jacob Crump, Jean Frédo Louis, Max Taggart

In the last two decades, the United States has been facing a surge in drug overdose deaths, especially opioid related deaths*. We have created an interactive visualization to allow users to view information about this epidemic from 1999-2015.
We showcase 5 categories:

* The rates of death by state.
* The categories of drug overdosing by total number of deaths
* The total number of deaths by days of the week (nationally or by state)
* The rate of death by gender (nationally or by state)
* The rate of death by ethnicity (nationally or by state)

The data comes from the WONDER CDC database using ICD 10 codes X40-44, X60-64, X85, and Y10-14.
